# K-Dimensional tree data structure Haskell implementation

### Tree structure reference:
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK5x7IUTIyU)

### Supported features:
1. Create empty K-d tree
2. Create K-d tree based on list of points - points will be automatically arranged according to K-d tree algorithm
3. Add point to tree, if point is not there already. The point will be added according to K-d tree algorithm.
4. Remove point from tree, if already present. The tree will rebuild itself according to K-d tree algorithm.

Repository also contains some demonstration of working with the implementation.
